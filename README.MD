# Parkinson's Detection using Machine Learning

- Parkinson's disease is a progressive disorder that affects the nervous system and the parts of the body controlled by the nerves. Symptoms start slowly. The first symptom may be a barely noticeable tremor in just one hand. Tremors are common, but the disorder may also cause stiffness or slowing of movement.

- To diagnose Parkinson's, a doctor will take a neurological history and perform an in-office exam. Although there are no standard diagnostic tests, some doctors may order imaging testing to help confirm a PD diagnosis in the early stages of the disease.
